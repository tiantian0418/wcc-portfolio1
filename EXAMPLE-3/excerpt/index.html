                This network of times which approached one another, forked, broke off, 
                or were unaware of one another for centuries, embraces all possibilites 
                of times. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >We do not exist in the majority of these</a>; 
                in some you exist, <a href="#" class="dead-link" >and not I</a>; in others I, and <a href="#" class="dead-link" >not you</a>; 
                in others, both of us. In the present one, which a favourable fate has granted me, you 
                have arrived at my house; in another, while crossing the garden, you found me dead; in still another, 
                I utter these same words, but <span id="ghost" >I am a mistake, a ghost</span>.
