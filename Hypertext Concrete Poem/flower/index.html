          I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart
          <br/>
          Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting
          <br/>
          Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of
          <br/>
          Eventually swaying in the desert oasis
          <br/>
          I believe I am
          <br/>
          Born as the bright summer flowers
          <br/>
          Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule
          <br/>
          Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome
          <br/>
          Bored
          <br/>
          I believe that all can hear
          <br/>
          Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own
          <br/>
          Some can not grasp the moment
          <br/>
          Left to the East to go West, Gu, the dead must not return to
          <br/>
          See, I head home Zanhua, in full bloom along the way all the way
          <br/>
          Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain
          <br/>
