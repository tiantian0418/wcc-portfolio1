        <h1>
        
          I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart
          Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting
          Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of
          Eventually swaying in the desert oasis
          I believe I am
          Born as the bright summer flowers
          Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule
          Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome
          Bored
          I believe that all can hear
          Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own
          Some can not grasp the moment
          Left to the East to go West, Gu, the dead must not return to
          See, I head home Zanhua, in full bloom along the way all the way
          Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain
